A C# 2010 program to get video streams from a connected Microsoft Kinect and save them to disk.

Requires:
Microsoft Visual C# 2010
Microsoft Kinect
Microsoft Kinect SDK 1.0b2 (or later)
Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) support, so you probably need Windows Vista or later to run it.

Have fun with it. I may add support for video compression later, if I have time.
